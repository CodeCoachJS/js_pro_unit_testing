### TODO

---

Run `npm run test:coverage` - you will see that 100% test coverage is not met! Add tests to get this app to 100% coverage.

You will find the coverage files here:

If you open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in the browser you will see the uncovered lines that need tests.

Once you make your tests, you should get to 100% like a boss.
